# Dewpoint_Affected_Pitches

Weather can alter the way a pitcher throws their pitches. Pitchers tend to not throw in rainy weather for very long -- usually, rainy games result in rain delays or rainouts -- but pitchers do still throw in games where humidity is a factor. Dew point is a measure of how much water vapor is in the air. As dew point increases, the "mugginess" feeling increases. This can affect the flight of a pitch and it can also affect the pitcher's comfortability.
Cincinnati in the summer can be one of the most humid-feeling parks to play in. At a dew point of 65 degrees F, the feeling of humidity becomes uncomfortable. For the purposes of this project and using the pitch data provided, please identify the probability a pitch was affected by a dew point greater than 65 degrees F.
